# Data-Analysis-Project-using-SQL-Unlocking-Insights-from-Raw-Data

SQL data analysis project aims to harness the power of structured query language (SQL) to extract meaningful insights from a large dataset by applying various SQL queries, Analyze and manipulate the data to answer critical business questions, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions.

# PROJECT LEARNINGS
1. Data Transformation : Transformed data as needed to prepare it for analysis. This involved aggregating, joining & pivoting the data.
2. Data Cleaning : Clean and preprocess the data to ensure its quality and reliability. This includes handling missing values, eliminating duplicates, and standardizing data formats.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Performed EDA using SQL queries to uncover patterns, correlations, and outliers within the data.
4. Performance Metrics: Develop SQL queries to calculate and visualize performance metrics that can provide valuable insights for decision-making.
